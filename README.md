Hello, I'm David

Experienced Tech Lead, Product-centered Full Stack Dev, Content Creator & entrepreneur. Enthusiastic about growth-mindset and self-development, passionate about Digital Marketing, UX & self-growth. Always try to maximize productivity and my teams' efficiency. I create content, write code & manage people.

As a Software Engineer: I create user-centered web and mobile applications using cutting-edge technologies like React Native, Flutter, GraphQL, and ESNext for more than 5 years. I love to learn new things by experimenting with state of the art technologies (mostly JS related). And because of my entrepreneurial mindset, I create apps business & product first, so I'm always involved in estimating, scoping, service design.

As a Content Creator: I like sharing my knowledge with others, so I write for several tech blogs and authoring my blog too. I also create content for Instagram and Youtube to teach software devs how to be successful as freelancers.

As a Manager: I've got experience in managing small & medium-sized product development teams, running a digital agency. We successfully finished several projects that were started from the ground up with lean, agile methods for multiple clients. I managed the projects from estimation & proposal, through design & development, until marketing & maintenance.
